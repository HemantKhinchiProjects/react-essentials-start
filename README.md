Q3. What is Props?
Ans - Props are special things you can pass to React building blocks (called components) to tell them what to look like and what to do.
They are like instructions for the components, telling them things like "show this text" or "use this color."
You can't change the props once you give them to a component, just like you can't change the color of a Lego block after it's snapped in place.
Imagine props as arguments passed to a function. Just like functions receive arguments and use them for calculations, React components receive props and use them to customize their behavior and appearance.
Props are read-only, meaning they cannot be changed within the receiving component. This ensures that data flows in a predictable and controlled manner throughout your React application.
Props are similar to HTML attributes, but they are more powerful and flexible. They can hold any type of data, including numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and even other React components.

Q5. What is State?
Ans - Lives inside the component.
Can change over time due to user interactions or other events.
Controls how the component looks and behaves (what it renders).
Causes the component to re-render whenever it changes, reflecting the new state in the UI.
Key points:

State is private to the component and should not be accessed directly from outside.
Use this.setState() to update state, which triggers a re-render.
Think of state as the dynamic, changeable data that makes your React components come alive!
I hope this analogy helps!
